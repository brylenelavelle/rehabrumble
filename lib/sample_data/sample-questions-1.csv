Neurology,Which of the following contain the cerebrospinal fluid and major arteries?,Dura mater,Pia mater,Arachnoid,Subarachnoid space,
Neurology,A patient is unable to detect crude touch and has decreased voluntary motor control. The Physical Therapist should suspect which of the following tracts to be involved?,DCML and corticospinal tract,Lateral spinothalamic tract and reticulospinal tract,DCML and reticulospinal tract,Anterior spinothalamic tract and corticospinal tract,
Neurology,"A patient recovering from an incomplete spinal cord injury at the L3 level (ASIA scale D). The patient reports difficulty going down ramps with unsteady, wobbly knees. An appropriate intervention for this problem would be:",Ultrasound therapy to reduce hamstring contracture.,Icing to decrease knee extensor spasticity.,Stretching plantar flexors using a posterior resting splint,Progressive resistance training for the quadriceps.,
Neurology,"A Physical Therapist is treating a patient who incurred a SCI secondary to a flexion injury status post a MVA. The patient has loss of motor function, pain and temperature below the level of the lesion, however, the patient has preserved proprioception and light touch. The Physical Therapist should suspect the patient has which of the following spinal cord syndromes?",Central Cord Syndrome,Posterior Cord Syndrome,Brown Sequard Syndrome,Anterior Cord Syndrome,
Neurology,"A patient is referred to PT for functional gait difficulties. The PT conducts the test as shown in the picture below. On stroking an object in the direction shown, there is extension of the big toe. The results of the test are MOST likely to indicate:",Positive Achilles reflex,Lesion of the anterior horn cells,Weak Dorsiflexion response,Upper motor neuron lesion,
Musculoskeletal,"Which of the following injuries occurs from repetitive overuse and affects the common wrist extensor origin of the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis, and extensor digitorum and digiti minimi?",Medial epicondylitis,Medial valgus stress overload,Fracture of the distal humerus,Lateral epicondylitis,
Musculoskeletal,"Which of the following injuries occurs from overuse and affects the origin of the pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, and the flexor carpi ulnaris?",Lateral epicondylitis,Medial valgus stress overload,Carpal tunnel syndrome,Medial epicondylitis,
Musculoskeletal,Why is early protection needed following the diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis?,The patient is in a high degree of pain and movement worsens the pain,The elbow is inflamed and movement will cause more inflammation,Active and passive range of motion (ROM) exercises for the elbow and wrist are needed from the splinted position,Excessive tissue scarring and random collagen fiber alignment would limit normal motion and function of the elbow and wrist,
Musculoskeletal,"In the initial healing stage, what actions does the physical therapist assistant (PTA) take to promote healing in lateral epicondylitis?",Encourage the patient to use the elbow and wrist normally,"Encourage exercises such as holding a hammer at the end of the shaft to promote greater control, strength, and torque",Encourage the patient to work through the pain to promote healing,"Make short-term modifications in activities of daily living (ADL) and job-related activities, AROM & stretching within pain free ROM limits, brace/strap fitting",
Musculoskeletal,"What does the counterforce brace do for the patient with lateral epicondylitis?
",Provides support to the upper arm when performing routine activities,Provides a reminder to the patient to perform activities and sports carefully to prevent further injury to the wrist extensors,Supports the forearm during sports activities,Dissipates the overload forces on the origin of the wrist extensors,
